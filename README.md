## Project Overview

This project is a modern web application built with React and TypeScript. It leverages Vite for fast builds and development, providing a smooth and efficient workflow. The application includes features such as:

- **Email Handling**: Using EmailJS to send emails directly from the client.
- **Mapping**: Integrating HERE Maps for interactive map functionalities.
- **Icons**: Utilizing React Icons for a wide variety of customizable icons.
- **Routing**: Implementing navigation with React Router DOM.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: You should have Node.js installed on your local machine. Download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ameduonekpe_project.git
   cd ameduonekpe_project
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Scripts

The project includes several NPM scripts to streamline your workflow:

- **Development**: Start the development server with hot module replacement (HMR).

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Build**: Compile TypeScript and build the project for production.

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Lint**: Run ESLint to lint the codebase, ensuring code quality and consistency.

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Preview**: Preview the production build locally.

  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```

## Dependencies

### Production Dependencies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React DOM**: Serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React.
- **React Icons**: A collection of popular icons as React components.
- **React Router DOM**: Declarative routing for React applications.
- **EmailJS**: Email sending service for JavaScript applications.
- **HERE Maps**: A powerful mapping and location service.

### Development Dependencies

- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
- **Various ESLint plugins**: Enhancing ESLint with additional rules and functionalities for React and TypeScript.

## Development Workflow

1. **Starting Development Server**: Run the development server to start working on the project.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Building for Production**: Build the project for production deployment.

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Linting**: Ensure your code meets the project's linting standards.

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

## Code Quality

The project uses ESLint for code linting, ensuring code quality and consistency. The ESLint configuration is designed to work well with TypeScript and React. To lint your code, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

The linter checks for issues and reports any unused disable directives with zero warnings allowed.

## Deployment

To deploy the project, build it for production and then host the output files on your preferred hosting service. For example, to deploy on Netlify:

1. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy**: Follow Netlify's deployment process, pointing it to the `dist` folder generated by the build.
